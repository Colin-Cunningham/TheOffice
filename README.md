This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

User Story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


App was created as way to demonstrate my capabilties in React.

App was made with bootstrap as well as font-awesome, and of course React. 


This app is a small project that allowed me to create sorting functions within the new model of react. I could have done a better job with seperation of concerns, and making more components. But as Michael Scott once said "Keep it Simple Stupid"
